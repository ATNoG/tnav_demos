# TNAV - Demos

One thing that you learn in a scientific enviroment is that you have to produce several demos to woo students and funding agencies.
This repository contains several pieces of code that are or were being used in demos that I produced.
It represents a fruitless effort to organize the code and simplifed the task of deploying demos.

## Arduino

We have some examples using two IoT boards NodeMCU ESP-12E (ESP8622) and NodeMCU 32s (ESP32).
The list of peripherals/sensors used is the following:
* Simple LEDs
* DHT22 (Temperature and Humidity)
* BME280 (Temperature, Humidity and Atmospheric Pressure)
* BH1750 (Light)
* SSD1306 (OLED 128x64 display)

## WebPages

Some web pages that connect to the WSGW through WebSockets and subscribe data from specific sensors.
